# humboldt
Performs spatial analyses of species' niche overlap in e-espace (environment or climate space).  This software is named after Alexander von Humboldt, who was a notable Prussian geographer, explorer, and naturalist. He is widely recognized for his works on botanical geography that laid the foundation for the field of biogeography. His greatest legacy is his sweeping idea about the interconnectedness of the world, however it would be wrong to see Humboldt as only a "big picture" man. Much of Humboldt's work was based on measurements - and lots of them. He used the best technology of the day to measure everything he could - temperature, humidity, the magnetic field. And alongside this were observations of rock and soil, fungi, insects, plants, animals and people.  Humboldt fused all of this together to show the links of dependency in nature connecting species distributions to key environmental variables. Since Humboldt, Lyell, Darwin, Mendel, and Grinnell brought us geology, evolution, genetics and niche theory, respectively.  Using these new concepts and modern tools, we continue to pursue Humboldt's basic ideas regarding drivers of the geographic distributions of species. This package builds upon the framework introduced by Dr. Olivier Broennimann that was published in 2012 in the paper entitled "Measuring ecological niche overlap from occurrence and spatial environmental data" in the journal Global Ecology and Biogeography (issue 21: pgs 481-497). For some functions, Humboldt builds upon their the framework, updating, supplementing to, and improving their supplied R code (as a derivative work). In many cases these scripts are entirely diffent and most analogous scripts represent entirely different calcuations. For many other functions, they are entirely new, such as 'humboldt.g2e','humboldt.doitall','humboldt.plot.overlap','humboldt.espace.correction','humboldt.top.env', 'humboldt.background.test' to name a few.
