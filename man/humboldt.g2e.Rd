\arguments{
\item{env1}{environmental variables for all sites of the study area 1 (env1). Column names should be x,y,X1,X2,...,Xn; with X1-Xn being any string label. If env1=env2, input the same file twice.}

\item{env2}{environmental variables for all sites of the study area 2 (env2). Column names should be x,y,X1,X2,...,Xn; with X1-Xn being any string label. If env1=env2, input the same file twice.}

\item{sp1}{occurrence sites for the species/population 1 at study area 1 (env1). Column names should be 'sp','x','y'}

\item{sp2}{occurrence sites for the species/population 2 at study area 2 (env2). Column names should be 'sp','x','y'}

\item{reduce.env}{the format to trim environmental space so that it is shared. If reduce.env=1, the second input environment (env2) will be trim the match the first input (env1). If reduce.env=2, both input environments trimmed so that extents of both are identical (the lower maximum value observed in env1 and env2 and the higher minimum value observed in env1 and env2 will be used to trim environmental space for each PC/environmental variable) If reduce.env=0, you will skip trimming environmental space}

\item{reductype}{if reduce.env= 1 or 2, the 'reducetype' parameter specifies the format for how to reduce environmental space ("PCA" or "STANDARD"). If reductype="PCA", the environmental space will be trimmed based on two principal components. If reductype="STANDARD", the environmental space will be trimmed by each included variable specified in col.env. if reduce.env=0, do not include this parameter}

\item{non.analogous.environments}{allow non-analogous environment in environmental space? If non.analogous.environments="YES" non-analogous environments between env1 and env2 will retained. If non.analogous.environments="NO" non-analogous environments between env1 and env2 will be removed. This parameter is only usable under the combinations of reductype="PCA" & reduce.env=1 or reductype="PCA" & reduce.env=2}

\item{nae.window}{the spatial window from which non-analogous environments will be quantified.  The non-analogous environments are characterized by gridding the espace of env1 and env2 into a R x R grind (e.g. 100 x 100).  If nae.window=0, values absent from a cell in one environment will be removed from the other.   If nae.window>0, values absent from a window (or neighborhood of cells) in one environment will be trimmed from the other.  The nae.window value characterizes the number of cells to search from the focal cell of environmental space values in the other environment.  The larger the nae.window value, the fewer non-analogous environments removed. This parameter allows imperfect overlap of environments.   If areas of environmental space are a little patchy between environmentsâ€”but generally present-- a larger nae.window value will retain more of the patch environments. The default value is a nae.window=5}

\item{env.trim.mcp}{trim extent of environmental data by buffered MCP in geographic space. Necessary for comparing different species or different extents, and for removing non-accesible environments}

\item{e.var}{selection of variables to include in all of the analyses- this is a separate parameter than col.env, but must contain all variables included in col.env}

\item{col.env}{if reductype="STANDARD", then parameter specifies the number of columns to trim environmental space on. This can be any number of columns}

\item{mcp.buffer.sp1}{buffer distance (in km) for trimming available environmental space for sp1}

\item{mcp.buffer.sp2}{buffer distance (in km) for trimming available environmental space for sp2}

\item{env.pca}{calibrate PCA on only occurrence data (env.pca=F) or environment data (env.pca=T), recommended is env.pca=T}

\item{rarefy.dist}{remove occurrences closer than a minimum distance to each other (this function uses the humboldt.occ.rarefy function). Values need to be in km[recommended] or decimal degrees. See associated parameter rarefy.units. Note: rarefy.dist=0 will remove no occurrences}

\item{rarefy.units}{the units of rarefy.dist parameter, either "km" for kilometers or "dd" for decimal degrees}

\item{env.reso}{the resolution of the input environmental data grid in decimal degrees}

\item{kern.smooth}{scale at which kernel smoothing occurs on environmental data, larger values (i.e. 2) increase scale (making a espace transitions smoother and typically larger) and smaller values (i.e. 0.5) decrease scale (making occupied espace clusters more dense and irregular). Note this value is only used in this script as a secondary test of espace trimming efficiency. Default value is 1}

\item{PROJ}{If PROJ =F, the models are calibrated on both ranges. If PROJ =T, the models are calibrated on species 1 range only and projected to range 2}

\item{R}{Resolution of grid in environmental space (RxR)}

\item{run.silent}{If run.silent=T, texts boxes displaying progress will not be displayed}

\item{thresh.espace.z}{this parameter is an experimental parameter and controls the level at which values below the kernel density z values are removed for creating areas of analogous environmental space. Higher values will increase value from which the low-density areas are removed from the environmental space of z1 and z2.  Basically values above this are retained and values below are removed. Default=0.001}
}
\value{
This function converts geographic distributions in environmental space (e-space). Several factors need to be considered when doing this. Do you include or exclude non-analogous environments? Do you trim environment space so that only shared environmental space is being analyzed? These factors directly effects the questions asked in humboldt.equivalency.test & humboldt.background.test.  For example, if run on full environment input for background tests and equivalency test, you are testing the total equivalence between species (or divergence) in current distributions. However if ran with trimmed, shared espace. The equivalency tests for niche evolution or niche divergence (as these measures should only be evaluated in shared analogous espace)
